Organization Hierarchy in the Access Control System

The Organization Hierarchy is a core feature of the Access Control System, designed to represent the structure of your organization and its departments in a clear visual format.
Current Implementation

The Organization page shows a hierarchical tree structure that represents:

    Organizational Units: Departments, divisions, teams, or any groupings within your company
    Parent-Child Relationships: How organizations relate to each other (which department is under which division)
    User Assignments: Which users belong to which parts of the organization

Key Features
Organization Structure View

    Expandable/Collapsible Nodes: Each organization unit can be expanded or collapsed to show or hide its sub-organizations
    Visual Hierarchy: Indentation and connecting lines clearly show the reporting structure
    Organization Details: Each node shows the organization name and optional description
    Action Buttons: Quick access to add, edit, or delete organizations

User Hierarchy View

    Toggle between views: Switch between organization structure view and user hierarchy view
    Position-Based Structure: Shows positions within each organization and their reporting relationships
    Vacant Positions: Clearly marks positions that don't have assigned users
    User Assignment: Ability to assign users to positions through a modal dialog

Management Features

    Add Organizations: Create new organizations at any level of the hierarchy
    Edit Organizations: Modify existing organization details
    Delete Organizations: Remove organizations (with safeguards against deleting non-empty units)
    Drag-and-Drop: Some implementations offer drag-and-drop reorganization capabilities

Technical Implementation

The hierarchy is implemented using:

    Tree Components: Recursive components that render parent-child relationships
    Collapsible Sections: JavaScript-powered expand/collapse functionality
    API Integration: Backend endpoints for CRUD operations on organizations
    State Management: Maintaining the expanded/collapsed state of tree nodes
